    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        In our project, we empirically investigate the performance of various matrix multiplication
        algorithms under a cache-adaptive model. We try to simulate a two-level memory hierarchy and
        see how the algorithm performs in the external memory model when the cache changes size. We
        then attempt to test the algorithms on a real machine, by checking the number of page faults the
        algorithm requires with varying cache availability. Both the simulation and on the real machine
        demonstrate that cache-adaptive algorithms are more stable as the cache profile varies.

        Formally, the cache-adaptive model can be seen as an extension to the disk-access model (DAM),
        where the costs are only incurred when the algorithm has to read or write information to the disk
        [1]. The cache-adaptive model is the case where we allow the size of the cache to change during the
        execution of the program. The intention of the cache-adaptive model is to mimic situations in real life
        where the cache available to a program is not stationary but is being divided based on the CPU and
        on the needs of the other competing processes.

        We can specify the memory profile of a cache as a function m : \( N \times N \) where \( m(t) \) is defined the
        be the number of cache blocks the cache has at the tth cache miss of the algorithm, and let the total
        cache size \( M(t) = B · m(t) \) where \( B \) is the cache block size [1].

                For any memory profile \( m \), the c-speed augmentation of \( m \) is defined as the memory profile

                For a problem \( P \), an algorithm \( A  \) is optimal in the cache-adaptive model if there exists some \( c \)
            and a large enough problem input size that, such that for any memory profile \( m \), the worst case
            running time of \( A \) on a c-speed augmentation of m is better than the worst-case running time of
            any other algorithm solving \( P \) on the memory profile \( m \).

        1. The class <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> represents the block data 
        in both <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>. 
        It is a list of integers and each element
        has 4-byte size. We utilize the object reference trick in which when we write to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> 
        in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>, the
        contents are also updated in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory</span>. 
    </div>
    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        2. The  class <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory</span> plays as a memory to store data. 
        It has only 2 main functions. The first function is named
        <span style="font-style: italic;">read_block_from_memory()</span>, which is used to 
        return a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> from a requested address. The second
        function is <span style="font-style: italic;">allocate()</span> which is used to initialize the memory according to the matrix data we used for
        multiplication. We store matrix in row-major order.
    </div>
    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        3. Our <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span> class is the linchpin of the simulator.
         It communicates with <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory</span> through <span style="font-weight: bold;">CPU</span>
        and transferring data using <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span>.
    </div>

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        4. There are three main eviction policies we implemented: <span style="font-weight: bold;">LRUPolicy</span> (Least Recently Used), 
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">LFUPolicy</span>
        (Least Frequently Used), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIFOPolicy</span> (First-In First-Out). 
        
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">LRUPolicy</span> evicts least recently
        used <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span>. To do this, the algorithm maintains an OrderedDict which has Doubly Linked List as
        underlying data structure. Everytime a block is accessed, it moves the index of block to the end. When
        cache is full, it would remove the index of blocks at the beginning. 
        
        In <span style="font-weight: bold;">LFUPolicy</span>, the policy evicts
        the one with least frequently used. We use a hashmap to maintain the frequencies of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> index. In
        removing phase, we need to loop through hashmap to find the index with least frequencies and remove
        it. 
        
        For <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIFOPolicy</span>, cache is evicted in order as they added. We maintain an OrderDicted to serve
        this purpose.

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        5. <span style="font-weight: bold;">CPU</span> contains three important functions. 
        The first one is <span style="font-style: italic;">read()</span> which is used to read a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> from
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>. 
        If this <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> is not inside cache, 
        it would be fetched from Memory and store inside
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>. 
        The second function is <span style="font-style: italic;">write()</span> which writes a byte to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> 
        in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>. 
        If no existing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span>,
        then the function requests <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory</span>, 
        update this <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span>, and write the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Block</span> 
        to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cache</span>.
        The final function is for the purpose of cache-adaptive: <span style="font-style: italic;">change_cache_size()</span>. 
        It updates the size of the cache every time a cache miss occurs according to a specific memory profile.
    </div>

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        6. This class is responsible for changing cache's size every time a cache miss occurs as in [1]. The memory
        profile is as followed:
        $$
            m(t) = \begin{cases}
            \text{$m$} & \text{if $t \leq m^{5/2}$} \\
            \text{$2m^{5/2} - t$} & \text{if $m^{5/2} < t < 2m^{5/2}-B$} \\
            \text{$B$} & \text{if $t \geq 2m^{5/2} - B$}
        \end{cases}
        $$

        where \(t\) is the \(t^{th} \) cache misses, \( m = c_1 B\), where \(c_1\) is any constant speed augmentation. Here we
    choose \(c_1 = 1\).
