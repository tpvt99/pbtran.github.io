                I am a robotics software engineer at 
                <a href="https://www.dyson.com.sg/" target="_blank">Dyson, Singapore</a>, 
                working in mapping and motion planning for vaccum robot. I was with
                <a href="https://unicen.smu.edu.sg/" target= "_blank" >Fujitsu-SMU Urban Computing and Engineering (UNiCEN) Corp. Lab</a>, 
                under supervision of <a href="http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/hclau/" target="_blank">Professor Lau Hoong Chuin</a>,
                where I worked in joint projects funded by <a href="https://www.y3technologies.com/" target="_blank">Y3</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.uparcel.sg/" target="_blank">uParcel</a> to engineer routing engines for logistics companies.
                I obtained Master in Computer Sceicne from 
                 <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">NUS, School of Computing</a>.
                I worked with 
                <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/" target="_blank"> Professor David Hsu</a> 
                for motion prediction and planning benchmarking project for autonomous driving car in my dissertation.

        <p class="block">During undergraduates, I had one year as a visiting student at NTU, Singapore where I worked with
        <a href="https://siewkeilam.github.io/ei-research-group/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Siew Kei Lam</a> and
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HsMFSVsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Thinh Pham</a> on a hardware acceleration 
        project for ORB object detection in self-driving cars system.
        During the time at NUS, I studied the effects of different motion prediction models on the performance of motion planning algorithms.

        <p class="block">
            I am interested in autonomous driving, especially in motion prediction and planning. 
            My current research focuses on planning under uncertainty by formulating the problem as a POMDP. 
            I am fascinated to explore how we can have an interpretable, safe, and robust planning for self-driving car.
            Towards that ends, I posit the consideration of three guiding design concepts: 
            (i) robust vision to detect objects (e.g., occupancy network, scene flow estimation), 
            (ii) jointly trained all modules in stack to reduce error propagation and 
            (iii) language models to intelligently plan and explain the decision.
