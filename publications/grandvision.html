    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        Law enforcement agencies in dense urban environments,
        faced with a wide range of incidents to handle and limited
        manpower, are turning to data-driven AI to inform their policing strategy. In this paper we present a patrol scheduling system called GRAND-VISION: Ground Response Allocation
        and Deployment - Visualization, Simulation, and Optimization. The system employs deep learning to generate incident
        sets that are used to train a patrol schedule that can accommodate varying manpower, break times, manual pre-allocations,
        and a variety of spatio-temporal demand features. The complexity of the scenario results in a system with real world
        applicability, which we demonstrate through simulation on
        historical data obtained from a large urban law enforcement
        agency.
