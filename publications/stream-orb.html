        The Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)
        feature extractor, which consists of key-point detection and
        descriptor computation, is a key module in many computer
        vision systems. Existing hardware implementations of ORB
        feature extractor only focus on increasing performance with
        power optimization as a post consideration. In this paper, we
        present a stream-based ORB feature extractor that incorporates
        mechanisms to lower the dynamic power consumption. These
        mechanisms exploit the fact that the number of detected keypoints is typically small. The proposed solution significantly
        lowers the switching activity of the key-point detection and
        descriptor computation stages by early pruning of non-likely
        key-points and gating the descriptor computation stages. Further
        power reduction and resource minimization are achieved by
        employing a threshold-guided bit-width optimization strategy to
        truncate the redundant bits in the key-point detection stage.
        Finally, we propose an approximation method to achieve rotation
        invariance of the descriptors. FPGA implementation targeting
        the Altera Aria V device shows that the proposed strategies lead
        to over 25% reduction in dynamic power and lower resource
        utilization, with only marginal loss in accuracy

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        We want to implement a power-optimized and stream-based ORB feature extractor 
        to achieve real-time performance in computer vision systems. Yet, there are two challenges:
        <ol style=" list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>
                Firstly, the key-point detection algorithm is computationally intensive due to the numerous addition and multiplication operators
                needed for calculating the corner response. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Secondly, a large number of row buffers are
                typically used in stream processing to cache the input pixel stream, which contributes to significant dynamic power 
                consumption and hardware resources.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        We thus introduce four main contributions to solve the aformentioned challenges:
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>
                We propose a new stream-based architecture for ORB feature extraction that utilizes an approximation angle 
                discretization method to acehive rotation invariance of the descriptors that avoids costly operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                We present strategies to lower the dynamic power by effectively inhibiting unncessary signal activities 
                in the key-point detection and descriptor computation pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
                We introduce a bit-width optimization strategy in the key-point detection stage to lower power consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
                We show that the proposed strategies maintain a marginal loss of accuracy while achieving notable savings in
                dynamic power and resource utilization on the Altera Aria V FPGA.

        First, we measure the accuracy of the key-points detector in which we use repeatability criterion, which measures the robustness against
        variety of changes in image conditions, i.e. rotation, scaling, and illumination. Here we report the difference in repeatability of 
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Prop2-KD</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Prop1-KD</span> which 

        $$
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta r = \frac{|\text{repeat}_{\text{Prop2-KD}} - \text{repeat}_{\text{Prop1-KD}}|}{\text{repeat}_{\text{Prop1-KD}}} \times 100 \%
        \end{equation}
