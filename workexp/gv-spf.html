    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        Law enforcement agencies in dense urban environments,
        faced with a wide range of incidents to handle and limited
        manpower, are turning to data-driven AI to inform their policing strategy. In this project, 
        we present a patrol scheduling system called GRAND-VISION: Ground Response Allocation
        and Deployment - Visualization, Simulation, and Optimization. <span style="color:red">The system employs deep learning to generate incident
        sets </span>that are used to train a patrol schedule that can accommodate varying manpower, break times, manual pre-allocations,
        and a variety of spatio-temporal demand features. The complexity of the scenario results in a system with real world
        applicability, which we demonstrate through simulation on
        historical data obtained from a large urban law enforcement
        agency.

    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        In the beginning of the project, we experimented a generative adversarial network to generate the incidents. 
        The data we have was crime's occurence, locations, urgency, numbers of police attended and engagement time. 
        For locations, we extracted latitude and longitude features.
        For occurence, we extracted thirteen boolean data: eleven public holidays of Singapore, 
        whether the day is weekend or weekday, and the day within week.
        We further encoded the cyclical continous features of time (into cosin and sine), such as day of weeks, day of years and week of months.
        For other features, we keep them as is. 
        We used WCGAN to predice desired features of a crime which are latitude, longitude, 
        crimes' occurence in minutes from midnight, urgency, engagement time and 
        number of police attended. We conditioned on the boolean data of occurence. 
        However, there is still one missing piece required in WCGAN which is the number of samples we want it to generate. Thus,
        we employed Ridge regression method to predict the number of incidents. The data we used for training is the cyclical continous features.
