  teammates: "Tran Phong"
  intro: "We designed a core CPU (LC3b) architecture of Illinois University with Verilog language, verified by VCS tool in Linux
  environment, and evaluated on FPGA (DEII Kit of Altera company).
  We proposed a pipeline architecture that functioned properly sixteen machine instructions and achieved 125 Mhz."
