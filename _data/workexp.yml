  intro: "In this work, I extend our developed engine 
    to cater for three main requirements from Y3 Technoligies: compatibility constraints (relationship between
    vehicles and locations), dynamic time/distance matrix (due to road construction)
    and optimized costs for each delivery routes."

  intro: "I developed two neural network models: i) WCGAN combined with linear regression on 
  tabular inputs and ii) Spatial-Temporal network in addition with VAE on images data to predict the crimes' locations and occurences.
  I also implemented local search to plan ahead of the patrol shift work plans with minimum time shift between locations.

  intro: "In this work, I used machine learning to predict the estimated time of arrival (ETA) between 
  two locations. I proposed a time-slot division strategy to find the lowest number 
  of vehicles before the neighborhood search  and post-optimized the schedule plans with redistributions of orders
   while violating minimum of soft constraints. I also engineered the frontend and backend of the system.
